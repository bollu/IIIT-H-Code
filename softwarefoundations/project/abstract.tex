\title{Project Abstract: Formally verifying Dining Philosophers as Feedback Control}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

We propose to formally verify the proof development as sketched in the
paper on ArXiV: \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02010.pdf}{Generalised Dining Philosophers as Feedback Control},
within the Coq proof assistant.
We will implement the proof, as laid out in sections
1, 2, and 3 (till \emph{The One Dining Philosopher Problem}) of the document
above.

Failing to complete the proof development,
we will lay out \emph{precisely} the point of failure in the verification, and
the ensuing issues with either the Coq proof assistant, or the previously
mentioned formalization. The target is conservative to hedge for things going
awry: even the best-laid-out-proofs have been waylaid on thier first contact
with a system as inflexible as Coq --- often, one has to massage theorem
statements and proof to appease the proof checker, for no
real gain or sense.

If the task of formalizing the first three sections (upto, and including
\emph{The One Dining Philosopher Problem}) proceeds faster than anticipated,
then as a \textbf{stretch goal}, we will attempt to formalize as much
of section 4 (\emph{N Dining Philosophers with Centralised control}) as possible).
