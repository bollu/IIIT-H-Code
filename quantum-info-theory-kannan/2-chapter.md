1. Why is it legal to have a differential equation with an expoential of a operator?

```
    i * dW/dt = HW => w = e^(-iHt) ?
```

How exactly do we "make sense" of the exponentiated operator? like, what the
hell is going on mathematically?

2. The relationship between unitary and hermitian matrices. Why does the
relationship exist? What makes the relationship work? any "deep" insight?

3. What exactly does it mean to multiply Hadamard gate n times? There
is a way of writing it using "multiplication", but it sure as hell
is not the usual multiplication, so I'm not sure what's going on

4. What does it even mean to say
(A \tensor B)^T ? I would think that this is _defined_ to be
A^T \tensor B^T, unless there is some other way to see this

5. One way to see this would be to go down to the kronecker written down
level and then see that it checks out, but that is stupid. Has to be a 
purely algebraic way to do this
