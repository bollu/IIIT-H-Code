Questions
=========
1. How to obtain combined state of quantum system given |q1> and |q2> as qubits?

2.
Why does the action of CNOT gate with 
a|0>(...) + b|1>(|00> + |11>) = a|0>(...) + b|1>(|10> + |01>) 
and not
a|0>(...) + b|1>(|00> + |11>) = a|0>(...) + b|1>(|11> + |00>) ? 

3. Why is a positive operator A (such that `<v, Av> > 0`) hermitian?

Indranil Sir Questions
======================

1. Before applying CNOT gate, there is a combined state. After applying, 
combined state changes. Bob knows that CNOT gate was applied(?)
